## Quickstart

```elisp
(require 'simpleclip)
 
(simpleclip-mode 1)
 
;; Press super-c to copy without affecting the kill ring.
;; Press super-x or super-v to cut or paste.
;; On OS X, use ⌘-c, ⌘-v, ⌘-x.
```

## Explanation

By default, Emacs orchestrates a subtle interaction between the
internal kill ring and the external system clipboard.

`simpleclip-mode` radically simplifies clipboard handling: the
system clipboard and the Emacs kill ring are made completely
independent, and never influence each other.

`simpleclip-mode` also enables support for accessing the system
clipboard from a TTY where possible.  You will likely need to
set up custom keybindings if you want to take advantage of that.

To use simpleclip, place the `simpleclip.el` library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:

```elisp
(require 'simpleclip)
(simpleclip-mode 1)
```

## Keybindings

Turning on `simpleclip-mode` activates clipboard-oriented key
bindings which are modifiable in `customize`.

The default bindings override keystrokes which may be bound as
alternatives for kill/yank commands on your system.  "Traditional"
kill/yank keys (<kbd>C-k</kbd>, <kbd>C-y</kbd>, <kbd>M-y</kbd>) are unaffected.

The default keybindings are

Keystroke                                 | Command
------------------------------------------|--------------------------------
<kbd>super-c</kbd> (*ie* <kbd>⌘-c</kbd>)  | `simpleclip-copy`
<kbd>super-x</kbd> (*ie* <kbd>⌘-x</kbd>)  | `simpleclip-cut`
<kbd>super-v</kbd> (*ie* <kbd>⌘-v</kbd>)  | `simpleclip-paste`
<kbd>C-&lt;insert&gt;</kbd>               | `simpleclip-copy`
<kbd>S-&lt;delete&gt;</kbd>               | `simpleclip-cut`
<kbd>S-&lt;insert&gt;</kbd>               | `simpleclip-paste`

The <kbd>super</kbd> keybindings are friendly for OS X: <kbd>super</kbd> is
generally mapped to the "command" key *ie* <kbd>⌘</kbd>.  The <kbd>insert</kbd>
and <kbd>delete</kbd> keybindings are better suited for Unix and MS Windows.

## Notes

`x-select-enable-primary` is not affected by `simpleclip-mode`.

Access to the system clipboard from a TTY is provided for those
cases where a literal paste is needed -- for example, where
autopair interferes with pasted input which is interpreted as
keystrokes.  If you are already happy with the copy/paste provided
by your terminal emulator, then you don't need to set up
simpleclip's TTY support.

The following functions may be useful to call from Lisp:

	simpleclip-get-contents
	simpleclip-set-contents

## Wayland

[wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) is used on Wayland systems to interact with system clipboard.

## Compatibility and Requirements

No external dependencies

Tested on OS X, X11, Wayland and MS Windows
